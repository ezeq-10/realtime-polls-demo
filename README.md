# Realtime polls demo

This demo server and clients was developed to support a talk on advanced Socket.IO topics.

## Running the demo

Start the server with `npm start`. Then, open a poll generator at `http://your-server:4000/gen` and as many clients as you want at `http://your-server:4000/cli`

Enjoy!
